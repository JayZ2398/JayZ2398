- 👋 Hi, I’m Jack (@JayZ2398)!
- 👀 I’m interested in formal methods and making the impending robot revolution better for everyone.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the landscape of formal verification (symbolic execution, verification condition generation) and web dev (for a job).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software projects where correctness is key (i.e. written in Haskell, Isabelle/HOL).
- 📫 You can reach me at `jacklzezula` on Gmail (you'll have to type my email yourself because although I'm excited about building robots, I'm not a big fan of talking to them).
